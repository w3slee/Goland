1. How are integers stored on a computer?
   - In a base-2 binary system
   - All integer types have a definate size
   - A 4 bit integer might look like 0000, 0001, 0010, 0011

   - Go integer types: uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, int8, int16, int32
   		       int64. (8,16,32,64 tell us how many bits each of the types useA)A

		       uint - unsigned integer ( only contain positive numbers or zero )
		       int  - signed integer

  - In addition there are two alias types: byte -> which is same as uint8
  					
				           1 byte         = 8 bits
					   1024 bytes     = 1 kilobyte
					   1024 kilobytes = 1 megabyte

  					   rune -> which is same as int32
  - uint, int and uintptr are machine dependant because their size depends
    on the type of architecture you are using

2. We know that (in base 10) the largest 1 digit number is 9 and the largest 2 digit number is
99. Given that in binary the largest 2 digit number is 11 (3), the largest 3 digit number is 111 (7)
and the largest 4 digit number is 1111 (15) what's the largest 8 digit number? (hint (used python conversion): pow(10,1)-1 =9 and pow(10,2)-1 = 99)
