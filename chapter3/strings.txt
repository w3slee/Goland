- We can express string in go using double quotes "Juicy Fruit" or backticks `Juicy Fruit`

- The main difference is the string in double quotes can contain special 
  escape sequences. \n -> gets replaced with a new line
	            \t -> get replaced with a tab character

- common string operations :
	> len("Numbers")      - finding the lenght of a string
	> "Numbers"[1]        - accessing an individual character in the string
	> "Hello " + "Kitty"  - concatenating two strings together
